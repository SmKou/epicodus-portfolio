            <p>Growing up, the only thing I wanted to be was a programmer, or developer. One of my moms was a programmer and she would sometimes tell me about her work, showing me diagrams of program logic and databases, letting me see some of her code, and once or twice letting me listen in on her meetings. However, in my family, I had a role and a place. Because I was female, I was told how I would live, what I would do, and what I would like. Because my brother had been identified as a mathematics genius when he was twelve, becoming an engineer or programmer was an option for him, not for me.</p>
            <p>Even though I took programming classes as part of the requisites for pre-engineering and informatics, and loved those classes, I stayed away from programming and learned mostly through trial and error on my own. For the most part, I stayed on track, ever veering away from programming and becoming a designer, afraid of losing the tenuous acceptance I received from my family, and ran away from them, all the way to China. Due to the sudden death of my father when I was five and the resulting environment of my upbringing, I developed and grew up with PTSD. When I went to China, I encountered trauma after trauma, one toxic environment or situation after another, and when I came back to the states, I carried with me a perpetual haze of exhaustion and fear.</p>
